              <p>A.&nbsp;The board is authorized to receive complaints against licensees, applicants, or other persons engaging in practices which violate or are alleged to violate the provisions of R.S. 37:2650 et seq.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp;Any complaint bearing on a licensee's professional competence, conviction of a crime, unauthorized practice, mental competence, neglect of practice, or violation of state law or ethical standards where applicable to the practice of speech-language pathology or audiology shall be submitted to the board.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;Complaints shall be in writing and signed by the complainant.</p>
<p>D.&nbsp;Once a written complaint is received, the board shall initiate a review of the allegations contained therein. The board may dispose of the complaint informally through correspondence or conference with the licensee and/or the complainant, which may result in a private letter of concern or a consent order. If the licensee stipulates to the complaint and waives her/his right to a formal hearing, the board may impose appropriate sanctions without delay. If the board finds that a complaint cannot be resolved informally, the written complaint shall be forwarded to the board's designated investigator for investigation. The board shall at that time notify the licensee, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the investigation.</p>
<p>E.&nbsp;The board's designated investigator shall have authority to investigate the nature of the complaint through conference, correspondence, and other investigative procedures, directed to those parties or witnesses involved. The board's designated investigator shall send the involved licensee notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the investigation containing a short summary of the complaint. All subsequent letters to the involved licensee, all letters to the complainant, or any other witness, shall be sent with a designation "personal and confidential" clearly marked on the outside of the envelope.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp;The designated investigator shall conclude the investigation as quickly as possible, without compromising thoroughness. Unless good cause is shown by the designated investigator satisfactory to the board, which may extend the time for the investigation, the investigation and recommendations to the board shall be delivered to the board within 60 days of the date that the designated investigator first received the assignment from the board.</p>
<p>G.&nbsp;Following an investigation, the designated investigator shall report to the board and make a recommendation for either dismissal of the complaint or proceeding to an informal hearing, consent order, or formal hearing.</p>
<p>H.&nbsp;The designated investigator may determine that the licensee's explanation satisfactorily answers the complaint and may recommend to the board that the matter be dismissed.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp;If the designated investigator's recommendation for an informal hearing is accepted by the board, the designated investigator shall notify the licensee of the time, date, and place of the informal hearing and of the issues to be discussed. The licensee shall appear on a voluntary basis. The licensee shall be advised that the hearing will be informal, no attorneys will be present, and no transcript of the hearing will be made. Any witnesses who testify will not be placed under oath, and no subpoenas will be issued. The licensee shall be informed that any statements made at the informal hearing will not be used or introduced at a formal hearing, unless all parties consent. If the licensee notifies the designated investigator that s/he does not wish an informal hearing, or if the licensee fails or refuses to attend an informal hearing, the informal hearing shall not be held. In that event, the board shall initiate a formal disciplinary hearing.</p>
<p>J.&nbsp;A complaint may be resolved by:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. a private letter of concern to the licensee or other appropriate parties.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. a consent agreement and order approved by the board and entered into by the licensee.</p>
<p>K.&nbsp;The designated investigator shall recommend to the board the initiation of a formal disciplinary hearing if the investigation discloses any of the following: the complaint is sufficiently serious to require a formal adjudication; the licensee fails to respond to the correspondence by the designated investigator concerning the complaint; the licensee's response to the designated investigator discloses that further action is necessary; an informal hearing is held but does not resolve all of the issues; or the licensee refuses to comply with the recommended remedial action.</p>
<p>L.&nbsp;The designated investigator shall submit any recommended action to the board in brief, concise language, without any reference to the particulars of the investigation, to any findings of fact or any conclusions of law arrived at during the investigative process.</p>
<p>M.&nbsp;The board shall have the authority to delegate to the designated investigator any alleged violations of the Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology Act, R.S. 37:2650 et seq., and any alleged violations of any and all rules and regulations adopted by the board pursuant thereto, prior to board action on those alleged violations. If requested by the board, the designated investigator shall submit to the board the complete investigation file. Final authority for appropriate action rests solely with the board including formal notification to the complainant and the licensee.</p>

              <p>A.&nbsp;If, after completion of the investigation, the board determines that the circumstances may warrant the withholding, denial, suspension, or revocation of a license, or other disciplinary action, the board shall initiate a formal disciplinary hearing. The board shall promptly notify the attorney general who is authorized and directed to appear on behalf of the state. The hearing shall convene in the parish in which the board is domiciled. The hearing shall be held before the board only after the involved licensee is given at least 30-days' notice by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice shall include the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.&nbsp;a statement of the date, time, place, and nature of the hearing;<br><br>2.&nbsp;a statement of the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held;<br><br>3.&nbsp;a reference to the particular sections of the statute and/or rules involved;<br><br>4.&nbsp;a short and plain statement enumerating the charges;<br><br>5.&nbsp;a statement advising the licensee of her/his right to be represented by legal counsel;<br><br>6.&nbsp;the names of the members of the hearing panel.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp;If the board is unable to state the charges in detail at the time the notice is served, the initial notice may be limited to a statement of the issues involved, thereafter, upon written request, a more definite and detailed statement shall be furnished.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;The board shall arrange for a certified shorthand reporter to make an accurate recording of all testimony presented and all documents entered into evidence at the hearing. A party wishing to file documents into evidence shall provide the court reporter with a copy marked for identification as an exhibit and shall provide copies to each member of the hearing panel, the board's legal counsel, opposing counsel, as well as counsel for any joined parties, and/or any unrepresented parties.</p>
<p>D.&nbsp;By bringing a complaint, the complainant waives the privilege of confidentiality for the purpose of the formal disciplinary hearing.</p>
<p>E.&nbsp;The rules of evidence, authority to administer oaths, issue subpoenas, conduct discovery, and control confidential privileged information shall apply to the formal disciplinary hearing in the form specified by R.S. 37:2656, 2663, the rules and regulations promulgated by this board, and as specified in the Louisiana Administrative Procedure Act, R.S. 49:950 et seq.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp;It is the licensee's continuing obligation to keep the board informed of her/his whereabouts. Accordingly, if notice of the hearing cannot be delivered by mail because of a licensee's change of address and the new address is not provided to the board, the board may hold the hearing in the licensee's absence, after making reasonable efforts to obtain the licensee's new address.</p>
<p>G.&nbsp;Within 15 days of the licensee's receipt of notice, s/he may file a written answer to the notice, denying some or all of the charges, or offering any explanation or asserting whatever defense s/he deems applicable.</p>
<p>H.&nbsp;The board shall have discretion to consolidate one or more cases for hearing involving the same or related parties or substantially the same questions of fact or law. The board may also grant separate hearings if a joint hearing may be prejudicial to one or more of the parties. If hearings are to be consolidated, notice shall be given to all parties in advance of the hearing.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp;The presiding officer shall consider a motion to modify or quash any subpoena issued in connection with the hearing, provided that such motion is filed by certified mail, return receipt requested, with the board at its registered office not later than three days prior to the hearing date or the date scheduled for the deposition, if the subpoena was issued in connection with a deposition. Possible grounds to quash or limit the subpoena include, but are not limited to: testimony on material protected by privilege or state regulation or other law; burdensomeness that would not be justified in light of the evidence important to the case; undue hardship on a witness; vagueness; immateriality.</p>
<p>J.&nbsp;The burden of proof at a formal disciplinary hearing rests with the attorney general who is bringing the charge before the board. No sanction shall be imposed or order issued, except upon consideration of the entire record, as supported by and in accordance with reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The standard of proof in all hearings before the board and for any review or examination of evidence provided by R.S. 49:957 or 958, shall be carried by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p>K.&nbsp;If the board finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the withholding, denial, suspension, or revocation of a license, or other disciplinary action is warranted, the board shall sanction said individual according to the provisions of R.S. 37:2662(B):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.&nbsp;refuse to issue a license;<br><br>2.&nbsp;refuse to renew a license;<br><br>3.&nbsp;issue a public letter of reprimand or concern;<br><br>4.&nbsp;require restitution of costs and expenses incurred by the board related to the enforcement of R.S. 37:2650 et seq.;<br><br>5.&nbsp;impose probationary conditions;<br><br>6.&nbsp;impose a fine for each violation not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation;<br><br>7.&nbsp;suspend a license;<br><br>8.&nbsp;revoke a license;<br><br>9.&nbsp;restrict the license by limiting or reducing the scope of practice; and/or<br><br>10.&nbsp;otherwise discipline a licensee.</p>
<p>L.&nbsp;A final decision or order adverse to a party in an adjudication proceeding shall be in writing or stated in the record. A final decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law. Findings of fact, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings. Parties shall be notified by the board, either personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, of any decision or order. Upon request, a copy of the decision or order shall be mailed to each party and to her/his attorney of record.<br><br></p>

              <p>A.&nbsp;The board is empowered to issue subpoenas upon receipt of a written request from the licensee or attorney general at least 15 days in advance of any scheduled hearing. The board shall issue said subpoenas upon receipt of said written request and receipt of any and all fees for subpoenas as provided for in §119.A.15 promulgated by the board.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp;The board may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for a contempt rule to show cause when there is a failure to comply with a subpoena.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;The board shall elect from its membership a person to act as presiding officer of the hearing. The presiding officer shall have the power to regulate the discovery process; hold pre-hearing conferences for the simplification or settlement of issues; convene the hearing; place witnesses under oath; take action necessary to maintain order; rule on motions and procedural questions arising prior to, during or after the hearing; rule on objections and admissibility of evidence; call recesses or adjourn the hearing; and prescribe and enforce general rules of conduct and decorum. The other board members may not delegate their decision making and fact finding duties to the presiding officer, nor shall the presiding officer have any greater weight in the decision making process than any other board member. The board's findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be signed by a majority of the hearing panel finding those facts and conclusions of law. Any member of the hearing panel disagreeing with those findings and conclusions may also file a dissent in the record with her/his decisions therefore.</p>
<p>D.&nbsp;Any board member having reason to believe that s/he is biased against one of the parties in the proceeding, or has a personal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, shall immediately notify the other board members and request to be disqualified. Any party to a hearing may file with the board an affidavit requesting a disqualification of a board member from the formal hearing because of the board member's bias or personal interest. As soon as possible, but no later than the beginning of the hearing, the majority of the board shall pass upon any request for disqualification. The concerned board member shall not participate in the deliberation of the board on the issue of disqualification, and shall not vote on the issue. If the board determines that there is no merit to the request for disqualification, the board shall proceed with the hearing. Any doubt concerning the fitness of a board member shall be resolved in favor of disqualification. In the event disqualification occurs, the board shall immediately request the governor to appoint a board member pro tem to replace the disqualified member for the hearing in progress only.</p>
<p>E.&nbsp;The parties to the hearing are urged, but not required, to confer prior to the hearing, through their respective counsel, or personally, to attempt to reduce or simplify the issues to be heard. The board shall honor any stipulations arrived at between the parties as proven facts at the hearing. The purpose at the pre-hearing conference is to insure that the hearing is not unusually delayed by receiving testimony or other evidence on matters which are not seriously in dispute between the parties.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp;The procedures as delineated by the Louisiana Department of Justice consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, R.S. 49:950 et seq., regarding the conducting of hearings and proceedings shall be implemented. A copy will be provided to any interested party involved with the hearing upon receipt by the board of a written request therefore.</p>
<p>G.&nbsp;Parties may conduct discovery pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, R.S. 49:950 et seq. Said discovery shall not unduly delay the hearing before the board.</p>
<p>H.&nbsp;For good cause shown, the board has discretion to extend or continue the time set for the hearing for such reasons as ill health, inability to obtain counsel, the complexities of the case, or such other matters deemed by the board to constitute good cause.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp;Upon request by either the licensee or the attorney general, witnesses shall be sequestered and not allowed in the hearing chambers during the hearing or permitted to discuss their testimony with other witnesses prior to the conclusion of the hearing.<br><br></p>

              <p>A.&nbsp;A decision or order in a case of adjudication shall be subject to rehearing, reopening, or reconsideration by the board within 10 days from the date of its entry. The grounds for such action shall be either that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.&nbsp;the decision or order is clearly contrary to the law and the evidence;<br><br>2.&nbsp;the party has discovered since the hearing evidence important to the issues which s/he could not have with due diligence obtained before or during the hearing;<br><br>3.&nbsp;there is a showing that issues not previously considered should be examined in order to properly dispose of the matter; or<br><br>4.&nbsp;there is other good ground for further consideration of the issues and the evidence in the public interest.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp;The petition of a party for rehearing, reconsideration, or review and the order of the board granting it, shall set forth the grounds which justify such action. Nothing in this rule shall prevent rehearing, reopening, or reconsideration of a matter by this board in accordance with other statutory provisions applicable to the board, or, at any time, on the ground of fraud practiced by the prevailing party or of procurement of the order by perjured testimony or fictitious evidence. On reconsideration, reopening, or rehearing, the matter shall be heard by the board. The hearing shall be confined to those grounds upon which the reconsideration, reopening, or rehearing was ordered. If an application for rehearing shall be timely filed, the period within which judicial review, under the applicable statute, must be sought, shall run from the final disposition of such application.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;If a petition for rehearing, reconsideration, or review is granted, the decision of the board is not final and therefore is not implemented until a decision is reached after the rehearing.<br><br></p>

              <p>A.&nbsp;A person who is aggrieved by a final decision or order in an adjudication proceeding is entitled to judicial review whether or not s/he has applied to the board for rehearing. A preliminary, procedural, or intermediate board action or ruling is immediately reviewable if review of the final board decision would not provide an adequate remedy and would inflict irreparable injury.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp;Proceedings for review shall be instituted by filing a petition in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge within 30 days after mailing of notice of the final decision by the board or, if rehearing is requested, within 30 days after the decision thereon.

<p>C.&nbsp;The filing of the petition does not itself stay enforcement of the board decision. The board may grant, or the reviewing court may order, a stay upon appropriate terms.</p>
<p>D.&nbsp;Within 30 days after the service of the petition on the board or within further time allowed by the court, the board shall transmit to the reviewing court a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review. By stipulation of all parties, the record may be shortened. A party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for the additional costs.</p>
<p>E.&nbsp;If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the board, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the board upon conditions determined by the court. The board may modify its finding and decision by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the reviewing court.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp;The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall be confined to the record. In cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before the board, not shown in the record, proof thereon may be taken in the court.
